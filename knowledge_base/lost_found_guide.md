# Lost & Found – How It Works

The **Lost & Found** section lets students report, search, and recover items easily.

## When You Lose Something
1. Tap the **Lost & Found** button from the home or community tab.
2. Select **Report Lost Item**.
3. Fill the details:
   - Item Name (e.g., phone, wallet, ID card)
   - Location where you lost it
   - Short Description
   - Upload a picture (optional)
4. Tap **Submit**.

Once you post:
- The app marks your report as **Lost**.
- All users get a **notification**.
- Your post appears in the Lost & Found feed.

## When You Find Something
1. Tap **Report Found Item**.
2. Add details:
   - What you found and where
   - Optional picture
3. Post it so the original owner can contact you.

## When Item is Found
- The post status automatically turns to **Found** once resolved.
- You can also manually mark it as found.

## Communication
If someone finds an item, they can message the user who posted the lost item directly.

## Safety
There are currently **no specific safety rules**, but users should avoid sharing phone numbers publicly in posts.
